#Time series is additive.
#The number of flights is lowest in November, December, January, and February. It is highest in May, June, July, and August. Therefore, this data is seasonal. The number of flights is higher in the summer months because the weather is warmer and people tend to take off work and travel. The total flights are lower in the winter months since the weather is cold and there are also a lot of holidays. People tend to stay home with their family during the holidays.

#ARIMA looks like the best forecast.

#Conclusion
#The ARIMA(0,0,1)(0,1,0)[12] with drift model is the best forecast to use to predict the total flights in the US over the next year. The ARIMA follows the seasonal trend of an increase in flights in the summer months, and a sharp decrease in the winter months. It accounts for an expected increase in total flights, due to more planes being built and more people wanting to fly places over time. 
#These seasonal fluctuations occur because people tend to go on vacations and travel in the summer when the weather is warm. Kids are out of school in the summer so it gives families an opportunity to travel places. In the winter, the weather is cold and most people are working or in school. Also, there are many holidays in the fall/winter, so people tend to stay home and be with their family.
#The ARIMA model had the lowest MAPE at 0.8080238, and the lowest RMSE 9025.336, indicating it had the smallest errors of all the forecast. There were no trend in the residuals, and when plotting the forecast vs the residuals, the errors were all concentrated around 0. The histogram of the residuals showed the vast majority of the errors to be within in -10,000 and 10,000 which is small for this data set. These accuracy measures all contributed to choosing ARIMA as the best model for predicting the total flights in the US over the next year.
#Insights
#Airline companies should have more planes and pilots on staff for the summer months, as there will be an increased amount of flights being booked during this time. Airports can also prepare for this by having more air traffic control workers during the summer, as well as more restaurants open for the larger crowds. In the winter, airline companies can limit the amount of planes being flown to limit mileage and fuel costs.
